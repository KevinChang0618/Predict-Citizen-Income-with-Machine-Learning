# Project Goal
Use different classification models to classify citizen's income with 50k or below 50k. And choose the best model with lowest error rate.

# Methods
Build five different models to test our data. We use Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, KNN, and Classification Tree to run our data.  
1. Logistic Regression with confusion matrix get accuracy 84.4% and error rate 15.2%  
2. LDA with confusion matrix get accuracy 83.64% and error rate 16.36%  
3. QDA with confusion matrix get accuracy 68.35% and error rate 31.95%  
4. KNN with confusion matrix get accuracy 79.67% and error rate 20.33%  
5. Classification Tree with confusion matrix get accuracy 84.46% and error rate 15.54%

# Conclusion
Based on above method results, the adult data analysis fit the Logistic Regression the best with the lowest prediction classification error rate.
